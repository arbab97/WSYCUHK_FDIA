## Deep Learning based Locational Detection architecture (DLLD)
Comparison  of  Deep  Learning  Algorithms  for  Site  Detection  of  False  Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids


## Requirements and Installation
We recommended the following dependencies.
All the requirements are given in 'gpu.yml'. However the environment will be set automatically when using the colab/notebook variant
## Training Data
### The training data file containsï¼š
{mention here about training data}

### The training data is generated as follows:  
{here paste steps for data generation} and cite the locational detection paper


##Running the Models
